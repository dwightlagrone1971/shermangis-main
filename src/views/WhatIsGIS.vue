GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and decision making.<a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Visit GIS.com.</a>
